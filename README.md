<h1>energy-calculator</h1>
This is the very fist project I uploaded to Github.

<h2>NAME</h2>
       energy_calculator - a program to compute kinetic, gravitational po‐
       tential, and elastic potential energy.

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
       energy_calculator

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
       The energy_calculator program interactively computes three types of
       energy:

       1. Kinetic Energy (KE): \( KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 \)
       2. Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE): \( GPE = m * g * h \)
       3. Elastic Potential Energy (EPE): \( EPE = 0.5 * k * e^2 \)

       Users select the type of energy to compute and input the required pa‐
       rameters. The result is displayed, along with a rounded result if ap‐
       plicable.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
       This program does not take command-line arguments. All inputs are en‐
       tered interactively.

<h2>USAGE</h2>
       Upon running the program, follow the prompts to calculate energy val‐
       ues. The program operates in an interactive loop and can handle mul‐
       tiple calculations until the user decides to exit.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

       Example 1: Calculate gravitational potential energy
              Input:
              Enter here >>> 2
              Enter mass(g): 70
              Enter gravitational field(N/kg): 9.8
              Enter height(m): 5
              Output:
              Result: 3430
              Rounded result: 3430

       Example 3: Exit
              Input:
              Enter here >>> e
              Output:
              **THANK YOU FOR USING ENERGY CALCULATOR**

<h2>BUGS</h2>
       No known bugs.
